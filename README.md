# RIVR
Responsive Interaction In Virtual Reality is a Cardiff University School of Computer Science &amp; Informatics Individual project.

- Requirements: Leap Motion, Arduino, 5 small vibrating motors. 

This repository is not actively maintained, I am currently working on a refined engine. I wish to one day come back to this project.

The system is a basic render engine which renders keys and a hand model, the hand model maps with motions and gestures that are mapped by using the Leap Motion.
